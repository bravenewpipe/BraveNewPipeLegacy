[Original NewPipe Readme](../README.md)
## About this fork
Due to restrictive project policy, the NewPipeTeam refuses to add platforms that they
find offensive. This fork (BraveNewPipe) will not be as restrictive. As long as the
platforms work in the spirit of free speech, they could be integrated.

Nevertheless, platforms that promote pornography or other degrading things will
__NOT__ be included here.

## Contribute
This fork will focus only on integrating other platforms. Unrelated patches will
be rejected for now.

Feel free to suggest which alternative platforms should be included. Any contribution
(development/testing/bug report) is greatly appreciated.

## Which additional platforms are supported?
- Bitchute
- Rumble

## Reporting bugs
Most problems with BraveNewPipe should be reported to the NewPipeExtractor
project, as platform support is developed there.
