[Original NewPipe Readme](http://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/#readme)

## About this fork
This fork is only for use on Android Kitkat aka 4.4 aka SDK 19.

The codebase is based on (Brave)NewPipe v0.23.3 as this was the last
version to support Android KitKat. I will only try to maintain the
functionality.

No features will be developed or backported by myself. If someone wants a
feature included, a PR can be created and if suitable I will add it.

## Which additional platforms are supported?
Same as [BraveNewPipe](../../../../NewPipe)

## Other features not found in NewPipe
- merged NewPipe x Sponsorblock into this fork. [NewPipe x Sponsorblock Readme](../README.md)
- searchfilters: in the action menu of the search page you can now change
  the search behavior for the actual search. The supported content/sort
  filters depend on the service. More information [PR TeamNewPipe#8837](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/8837)

## Reporting bugs
Most problems with BraveNewPipe should be reported to the NewPipeExtractor
project, as platform support is developed there.
